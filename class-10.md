## Debugging

**What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript**

1. Syntax errors are spelling errors in your code that keep the program from running. Logic errors are when the syntax is right but there is an error in your actual code.

2. I have had many syntax errors and which are super frustrating because everything seems to look right in your code but I just couldn't figure out what was wrong. Sometimes you just need fresh eyes to look over it. That has helped me to fix those errors in some of my labs.

3. These concepts help you to be more aware and intricate when writing your code. This will help as I move forward in development.


**The JavaScript Debugger**

1. The JavaScript Debugger helps you to take a beat and check that your code is working properly before moving on to writing more code.

2. A breakpoint is a spot in which JavaScript will stop executing your code to let you see if your values are working.

3. This is a mechanism for someone interpreting your code to track of your functions.
