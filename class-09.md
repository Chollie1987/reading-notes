## Forms and Js Events


**HTML Forms**

1. Forms are important because they are used to collect data from users allowing user interface control.

2. Key things to keep in mind when creating forms are to keep them simple and short to make the user experience less frustrating. Make a rough sketch so you have and idea of your layout and how you want the user to interact with it. 

3. 5 form elements:
 -action - defines the location where the form collects the data and where that information is sent to.
 -method - defines which HTTP method is used to send that data.
 -input fields - for either single lined text or ones that only accept email addresses.
 -button elements - These are used to send or submit the users form data.

1. Events are actions that happen within the programming when there is an interaction. Like clicking a button on a webpage and the page reacts to that event like taking you to another page or displaying information, etc. 

2. 2 arguments you need to provide with addEventListener methods are to add the string 'click' to express that you want to listen for a click event, and a function to call for after that click event takes place. 

3. An event object is a parameter set inside the event handler function. The target property of that event object is a reference to the element the event is occuring. 

4. The difference between event bubbling and capturing is bubbling describes how the brower handles targeted events in nested elements. Capturing is similair but in reverse so it starts with the nested elements then moves toward the target until reached.
