# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

**JavaScript Object Basics**

1. An object is data and the functionality of that data.

2. Some advantages of creating object literals are it provides shorter sytax for defining functions and for creating properties for variables.

3. The difference between objects and arrays are objects represent things with characteristics and arrays are like lists with single variables.

4. You would use bracket notation to access an object's property if you wanted to iterate over all the keys in an object to access their values. You can't do that with dot notation.

5. Not sure about this one. I think the "this refers to the const dog, but I'm not sure.

**Introduction to the DOM**

1. The DOM is the Document Object Model, which is data that represents objects which make up the structure for web documents.

2. JavaScript is a programming language and uses the DOM to access documents and it's elements. The DOM is not a language but without is JavaScript wouldn't have the model or notion of web pages.
