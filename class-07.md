# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

**Domain Modeling**

1. Domain modeling helps conceptualize a model for a particular problem. When this is done properly it can help your understanding of that problem. 

**HTML Table Basics**

1. You shouldn't use tables for page layouts because the goal is to separate content and structure from presentation.

2. Three different semantic HTML elements are 
    *section* - This defines a section in your document, such as chapters.
    *header* - A header element contains your most important part of your document, like your introduction and can hold other elements like h1-h6, etc.
    *footer* - A footer goes at the bottom of the page and holds information like your copyright info or contact info, etc.

**Introduction Constructors**

1. Constructors are methods that execute everytime you create and object.

2. Not sure how to answer this at the moment.

**Object Prototypes Using A Constructor**

1. Prototype and inheritance analogy from previous work experience. I have to think about this more.
