# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

**Creating Hyperlinks**

1. A link is created by wrapping the text or content in a block level link. 

2. The href element contains the web address

3. You can add titles to your links which can contain information the page contains and show you what to be aware of on the website.

**CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning**

1. Normal flow is the way that block and inline elements are displayed on a page before changes are made. 

2. Block level elements always start on a new line they also take up the full width available. Inline does not start on a new line and takes up as much width as necessary.

3. Static is the default positioning for every html element.

4. A few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element is good cross-browser support. Less dependence on margins and floats.

5. The key difference between fixed and absolute positioning is absolute fixes and element in place relative to it's nearest positioned ancestor and fixed usutlally fixes and element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

**Functions-Reusable Blove of Code**

1.A function declaration introduces an identifier that designates a function and optionally, specifies the types of the function parameters. Function invocation is used to execute the function code.

2. A parameter is a kind of varible used in a funciton to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the function. An arguement is a value passed to a function when the function.

**Miscillaneous**

1. Two benefits of pair programming for me would be engaged collaboration and job interview readiness. Those are both things that I need to get comfortable with.
